**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The programs work as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments throughout. I was given permission
      via webmail to write the morse code into an array rather than read it in from the file, but in the 
      end I chose not to take this concession.
   
      
<-s>: This particular assignment was difficult to complete and organize, but it was fun to learn about conversions!
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to continue learning to convert strings into codes, like Morse code!
